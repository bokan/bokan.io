        <h1>if you're still using your keyboard, you're ngmi</h1>

        <img src="kbd.jpg" alt="keyboard" class="hero-img">

        <p>Your keyboard is a relic. A 152-year-old crutch designed for machines that couldn't understand you.</p>

        <p>In 1868, Christopher Latham Sholes patented the first practical typewriter and introduced the QWERTY layout. Six years later, Remington put it on the market. The layout was engineered to slow typists down, to prevent mechanical keys from jamming on a device that no longer exists.</p>

        <p>And here you are, in 2026, still pecking away at those same keys like it's the Industrial Revolution.</p>

        <h2>the keyboard was a crutch</h2>

        <p>Think about why the keyboard exists. Before AI, computers were glorified calculators. Fancy abacuses. A child's toy that could do math really fast. Zero understanding. Zero intelligence. They needed precise, mechanical input because that was the only language they spoke.</p>

        <p>You learned to type because machines couldn't listen.</p>

        <p>The keyboard was humanity's adaptation to dumb machines. We had to translate our thoughts into keystrokes, our intent into syntax, our ideas into commands. We bent ourselves to fit the machine's limitations.</p>

        <p>That era is over.</p>

        <h2>the machines can hear you now</h2>

        <p>Claude Opus 4.5. GPT 5.2 Codex. These aren't calculators. They're intelligent systems that understand natural language, context and intent. They hear you. They see you. They talk back.</p>

        <p>You're not feeding punch cards into a mainframe anymore. You're having a conversation with an entity that comprehends what you actually mean.</p>

        <p>So why are you still typing?</p>

        <div class="tweet-embed">
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is what vibe coders need in 2026.</p>&mdash; shirish (@shiri_shh) <a href="https://twitter.com/shiri_shh/status/2009973702314864680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></blockquote>

        </div>

        <h2>bandwidth: let's see the numbers</h2>

        <p>Speaking: ~150 words per minute.<br>
        Natural conversation. No effort. No friction. Just think and talk.</p>

        <p>Typing: 40-80 wpm for most people.<br>
        Requires focus, coordination, years of practice.</p>

        <p>That's a 2-4x difference. And that's before you factor in the cognitive overhead of translating thoughts into keystrokes versus just saying what you want.</p>

        <p>It's like writing assembly when you could describe what you want in plain English. Made sense when the compiler couldn't understand English, but the compiler understands English now.</p>

        <h2>the shift already happened</h2>

        <p>Old paradigm: Human adapts to machine. Learn to type. Learn syntax. Learn commands. Memorize hotkeys. Get faster at speaking the machine's language.</p>

        <p>New paradigm: Machine adapts to human. Understands speech. Gets context. Fills gaps. Asks clarifying questions. Speaks your language.</p>

        <p>We spent decades optimizing ourselves to interface with dumb machines. Now the machines are smart enough to meet us where we are.</p>

        <p>If you're still optimizing your typing speed, you're training for a race that ended years ago.</p>

        <h2>adapt or get left behind</h2>

        <p>This isn't about voice being slightly more convenient. It's about a fundamental shift in how humans interact with machines. The keyboard was a bridge technology. Necessary when machines couldn't understand us. Obsolete now that they can.</p>

        <p>The people who thrive in this era communicate naturally with AI. They think in intent, not keystrokes. They use the full bandwidth of human expression instead of a narrow channel designed in 1868 to prevent mechanical jams.</p>

        <p>The people clinging to keyboards because "that's how I've always done it"? They're optimizing for a world that doesn't exist anymore.</p>

        <p>You learned to type because you had no choice. Now you have a choice.</p>

        <p class="closing">still typing everything out?</p>
